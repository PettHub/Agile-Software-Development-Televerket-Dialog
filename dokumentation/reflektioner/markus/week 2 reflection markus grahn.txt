1. what do I want to learn or understand better?

Im not quite sure yet. I feel like I have a better understanding for the group as a whole and I want to help push us to having a better overview of the project as a whole


2. how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

to offer them my perspective and allow everyone to take part of the discussion to make sure everyone can have an input and think more about the issue/the new thing


3. what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

We haven't started using Scrum yet so my contribution is not there.


4. what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I have helped with the contact between our group and the client to make sure everyone is onboard with the project that we are going to develop.
