1. what do I want to learn or understand better?
Not too sure anymore, I feel like I have proper understanding of most things we are doing right now. 

2. how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Same as earlier, offer my knowledge and help to other members of the team to try and crack the problem together. 

3. what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I help make sure that the stories are moved properly and talk with the rest of the group if we need to add more to the scrum board

4. what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I helped code a bunch this sprint and worked together with my programming partner to have an efficient work flow
