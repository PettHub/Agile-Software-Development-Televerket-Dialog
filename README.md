Important note: We have been programming in pairs and groups throughout the weeks, switching pair/group each week. And we have mostly used Live Share, resulting in only one person per group committing code. So the git commit history/the built-in contribution check does not properly reflect each person's contribution.

Structure
Team reflections have been submitted in canvas and are not uploaded to git. 
However, the individual reflections can be found here "dokumentation > reflektioner".
All the code is under folder "projektfiler".
