what do I want to learn or understand better?
How asynchronous functions work and how to work around them in a way to predict outcome.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
by learning it myself

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Same as usual, helping at the start of the sprint with assigning groups and then just following the rules.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
A way to tally votes using said asynchronous functions. Turned out to be more of a headache than previously thought.
