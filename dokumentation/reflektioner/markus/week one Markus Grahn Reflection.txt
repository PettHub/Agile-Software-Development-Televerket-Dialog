1. what do I want to learn or understand better?

I want to learn more about the group members so far. My focus will shift once we get more into the project but for now I want to get a feel for everyone's strengths so we can work efficiently as a team
It will also be fun to learn how to properly set up a discord bot and work with that. 


2. how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Work with them together on a part and or make sure everyone have a chance to give feedback or ask for help when we are discussing ideas in a group. 


3. what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

We haven't started using Scrum yet so my contribution is not there.


4. what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I have helped developed an idea and somewhat taken a leader role to help guide our meetings and made sure everyone are able to get the help they need and understand the tools we have shown.
