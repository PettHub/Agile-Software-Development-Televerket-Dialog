####what do I want to learn or understand better?
as the project is nearly done i don't belive there will be many more learning opportunities during the course, i am however interested in using what i've learned in the course in future projects
####how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
as stated above we don't have much work left and the last bit is pretty much gold plating and paying off technical debt with few learning opportunities besides probably that it's good to plan a structure before coding so that we would not have to refactor the main class in the final week
####what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
participating in diskussions 
####what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
doing my part :)
